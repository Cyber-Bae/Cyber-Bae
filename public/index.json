Even highly experienced developers might have trouble landing a job in the current market. With that being said, here are 3 big reasons why having a strong email signature is crucial:\nIt showcases your professionalism and attention to detail. Your email is your first impression in the professional world, and it should reflect your brand and uniqueness as an individual. By utilizing graphics and design elements, you not only showcase attention to detail, but also elevate your professionalism. A plain email lacking visual appeal may not catch a recruiter's eye and could potentially put you at a disadvantage among numerous other applicants vying for the same position. Take advantage of this opportunity to market yourself and stand out from the crowd by creating a visually appealing email that represents who you are and what sets you apart in the industry.\nIt provides important contact information for potential employers or clients. Having readily available contact information is vital for establishing connections with potential employers and clients. By providing a clear and easy way for recruiters or business partners to reach you, you are showing your professionalism and readiness to engage in potential opportunities. In today's fast-paced world, having accessible communication methods can make a significant difference in securing future partnerships or employment opportunities. So, it's important to ensure that your contact information is always up-to-date and easily accessible for those seeking to connect with you.\nIt can include links to your portfolio or social media accounts. Your portfolio or social media accounts can be a valuable addition to your presentation. Be mindful of the platforms you choose to share, as they can reflect on your professional image. Consider linking to your personal Github and LinkedIn, showcasing your skills and experience. And don't be afraid to include a bit of personality by sharing your personal website or blog as well. Just remember to keep it professional!\nThe job market can feel ruthless, but with a few seemingly minor tweaks to your digital presence, you'll have a greater advantage over most of your competition. With that being said, here are steps you can take to create a personalized email signature.\nBut side note: Email signatures may appear differently depending on the platform they are viewed on. For example, images may not display consistently on Gmail and may take up to a day to fully render.\nSo, take a look at this CodePen code:\nSee the Pen Email Signature by Michelle (@a-m-long) on CodePen.\nThis code contains some scripts for Instagram, GitHub, and LinkedIn. I was concerned that these external links wouldn't work but after a few days on Gmail, they seem to render on my email signature.\nTo access your Gmail settings, click on the gear icon and select \u0026quot;See all settings.\u0026quot; Then, scroll down to find the option for adding a signature.\nBy now, you should have the ability to copy the html page and paste it into the Gmail signature section, whether that means running a page from your internal server or copying it from CodePen.\nWhen crafting your own personal email signature, consider these professional tips to create a polished and impressive signature:\n1. Keep it simple and clutter-free. Your email signature should be concise and visually appealing. Avoid using excessive colors, fonts, or images that may overwhelm the recipient.\n2. Choose a legible font. Opt for a readable font such as Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman, as they are widely recognized and display well on all devices. Avoid using flowery or cursive fonts.\n3. Include your full name and title. Make sure to include your complete name and job title in your signature for clarity and professionalism. This helps the recipient identify who you are and your role in the company.\n4. Maintain consistent branding. If creating an email signature for your business, ensure it aligns with your brand's visual identity, including fonts and colors used on your website and marketing materials.\n5. Add a professional headshot. Consider adding a high-quality headshot to personalize your signature and put a face to your name. Ensure the photo reflects your professionalism.\n6. Proofread meticulously. Before finalizing your email signature, carefully proofread for any spelling or grammar errors. A simple mistake can leave a negative impression on potential employers or clients.\n7. Test on various devices. Test your signature on different devices like desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones to ensure it displays correctly across all platforms.\nBy following these tips, you can create an effective and visually pleasing email signature that will make a strong first impression on potential employers or clients. Remember to update your signature regularly with any changes to your job title, contact information, or social media handles.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/2024/01/why-strong-email-signature-is-vital-in.html","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Why a Strong Email Signature is Vital in Today's Competitive Job Market"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/tags/coding/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Coding"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/series/Job-Search-Bootcamp/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Job Search Bootcamp"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/tags/programming/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Programming"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/categories/programming/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Programming"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"Programming is a valuable skill that can be used in a variety of industries. In 2024, the demand for programmers is expected to continue to grow, making it a great time to start learning how to code.\nHere are some of the benefits of programming in 2024: High demand and good pay: Programmers are in high demand, and they can command high salaries. The median salary for a programmer in the United States is over $100,000 per year.\nJob security: The demand for programmers is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, so programmers are likely to have job security.\nRemote work opportunities: Many programming jobs can be done remotely, which gives programmers the flexibility to work from anywhere in the world.\nCreative outlet: Programming can be a creative outlet, as it allows you to build things and solve problems.\nIntellectual challenge: Programming can be intellectually challenging, which can be stimulating and rewarding.\nMake a difference: Programming can be used to make a positive impact on the world. For example, programmers can develop software that helps to solve problems such as climate change and poverty.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/post/benefits-of-programming-copy-2/","section":"post","tags":["programming","coding"],"title":"The Benefits of Programming in 2024"},{"body":"\rI find it concerning when people join online forums and discuss how to get a tech job without needing to ever touch code or have a degree in computer science, IT, or any other related field.\nIt only serves to make it tougher for those people who don't possess the diploma, but are serious about gaining experience, to be taken seriously. Eventually, businesses will start sifting through resumes and only consider applicants with relevant degrees from the industry.\nTechnical know-how can be a tremendous aid to your career, and to the people around you. If you want to select the most capable candidates for positions on your team, or understand the technical details behind clients' requirements, having development experience is essential.\nWhile the actual coding might be left to tech leads and developers, with a technical background, you can bridge any divide between business goals and software solutions.\nThe challenge of working people who don’t necessarily have the technical know-how is particularly noticeable when dealing with scrum masters. A competent scrum master will ensure team meetings run on time, personnel are properly organized, and projects are completed in a timely manner.\nNever underestimate the importance of having clearly defined tickets. They are essential to ensuring successful completion of a sprint. A decent scrum master is so much more than a taskmaster: they are also adept at identifying and removing blockers, ensuring seamless communication between different teams, and effectively communicating the required tasks that need to be accomplished.\nA bad scrum master, on the other hand, will be a liability to their team, an additional burden that slows down progress. Poorly tracked business requirements, excessive meetings that eat into valuable coding time, and developers forced to take up the slack left by an inadequate scrum master are all indicators of this kind of sub-par performance.\nRemember: your team's success depends on your ability to lead them effectively. With that being said, here are 5 reasons why scrum masters should have a technical background.\n1. It gives you an edge when selecting team members — You will be able to better evaluate the technical skills of potential candidates and ensure that your team has the expertise it needs for optimal performance.\n2. You can understand requirements and technical solutions better — Having a technical background gives you a better understanding of the client's requirements, as well as the software solutions required to fulfill them.\n3. You can bridge any divide between business goals and software solutions — As a scrum master, you are responsible for ensuring that organizational objectives are met, but programming experience helps you better connect with developers and make sure their work aligns with the company’s desired outcomes.\n4. You're more adept at troubleshooting any issues — With development experience, you can spot issues in production applications quickly and begin to work on solutions right away, rather than having to wait for others to come up with ways around them.\n5. You can provide more effective guidance — Being able to speak the same language as your developers and tech leads allows you to offer meaningful advice regarding their projects and help them prioritize tasks more effectively. This makes everyone’s workload lighter while still reaching all goals in a timely manner.\nI'm a firm believer that people should have the chance to get into tech if they're willing to put in the effort. Just keep in mind that these jobs aren't as easy as some may think, especially without prior technical knowledge. You'll end up creating a lot of stress for yourself if you don't take this into consideration.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/2023/04/attention-all-scrum-masters-heres-why.html","section":"post","tags":["Lifestyle"],"title":"Attention all Scrum Masters: Here's Why YOU Should Learn Programming!!!

This is especially true for women and minorities who may experience even more alienation in this field due to any impolite remarks or animosity they may encounter in their surroundings.\nI strive to maintain a sense of autonomy in my relationships with others, rather than attempt to manipulate their behavior. I focus on how I can manage my own thoughts and actions in response to those around me, rather than try to control their decisions. By adopting this attitude, microaggressions will become easier to ignore.\nIn order to be successful as a woman in tech, it's important you keep this advice in mind: always remain true to yourself.\nAt some point, we have to ask ourselves if we really feel as if we're tapping into our full potential at work. I was surrounded by seasoned professionals who had been established in the industry longer than I had been alive.\nTheir sophisticated discourse intimidated and challenged me, but rather than being intimidated by the fact that I was the only woman in the room, I aimed to increase my knowledge of engineering and push my skills further. And there are empowering ways to developing your skillsets beyond aimlessly studying online or solving Hacker Rank problems. Try answering these questions:\n1. What do you do to stay motivated when things get tough?\n2. Are there any groups you can join or resources you can use to help further your development?\n3. How can you make yourself an asset in the workplace?\n4. What steps do you need to take to ensure that your voice is heard in the office?\n5. Are there any mentors who can help guide and support your progress?\n6. Is there a way for you to create a safe space for other women and minorities in tech?\n7. What advice do you have for other women and minorities who are trying to break into the tech field?\n8. What do you think is the most important skill or trait you need to succeed in tech?\n9. Are there any organizations or networks that provide resources and connections for women and minorities in the tech industry?\n10. How can you make sure that your work is seen and appreciated in the workplace?\nIf you find yourself vexed by these inquiries, then be truthful with yourself and explore roads for your individual evolution. That could be a fantastic point to begin or even revisit.\nFor me, I found myself pivoting away from traditional engineering activities into more creative ones. It was important to find ways to push myself and challenge my skillset, but also make sure I could still contribute to the team in a meaningful way.\nTo do this, I sought out mentorship, took on additional responsibilities outside of engineering (such as content creation or marketing), and explored new outlets for creativity. Additionally, I made sure to network with other minority professionals in tech, attend conferences focused on women in tech, and join diversity groups both online and in-person.\nThese experiences enabled me to create a unique skill set that allowed me stand out as an individual and not just another female engineer. Through these different avenues of growth, I was able to hone my technical proficiency while also developing soft skills that helped foster relationships with my colleagues. Ultimately, this enabled me to gain recognition for the value I provided.\nBy understanding ourselves better and having the courage to explore our unique interests, we can create an established presence within the tech industry that allows us to build our networks and build successful careers on our own terms.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/Cyber-Bae/2023/04/succeeding-as-woman-in-tech.html","section":"post","tags":["Lifestyle"],"title":"Achieve Your Goals as a Woman in Tech: 10 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself for Success in the Industry."},{"body":"Empowering the Next Generation of Tech Heroes In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, where innovation thrives and challenges abound, one crucial aspect often lacks diversity: representation.
